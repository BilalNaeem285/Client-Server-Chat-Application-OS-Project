This project is a multithreaded chat application developed in C on a Linux platform, demonstrating core concepts of multithreading and socket-based interprocess communication (IPC). The system follows a client-server architecture, where the server uses POSIX threads (pthreads) to handle multiple clients simultaneously, allowing real-time message exchange without delays or blocking. TCP sockets are used for reliable communication, and messages from one client are broadcast to all connected clients. This project highlights practical applications of concurrent programming, thread management, and network communication in operating systems.
